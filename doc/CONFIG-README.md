## Safety Tips

### **Rate Limiting**
- Keep `daily_limit_per_account` under 300
- Use long delays between comments (7-8 minutes minimum)
- Don't run 24/7 - give accounts breaks

### **Natural Behavior**
- Use varied comments (at least 10-15 different ones)
- Mix hashtag targets
- Don't use the same pattern every day

### **Account Safety**
- Use accounts you don't mind losing
- Don't use your main Instagram account
- Enable 2FA on important accounts (bot will skip them)

### **Technical**
- Keep Chrome browser updated
- Update ChromeDriver when Chrome updates
- Monitor error logs for issues

---

## Common Issues

**"ChromeDriver not found"**
- Download ChromeDriver and put in `chrome/` folder
- Make sure version matches your Chrome browser

**"Login failed"**
- Check username/password spelling
- Account might have 2FA enabled
- Account might be temporarily blocked

**"No posts found"**
- Hashtags might be too specific
- Try more popular hashtags
- Check if hashtags still exist

**Bot runs too fast/slow**
- Adjust delay settings in `settings` section
- Increase delays if getting rate limited
- Decrease delays if bot is too slow

## Example Good Configuration

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "daily_limit_per_account": 150,
    "comments_per_session_min": 3,
    "comments_per_session_max": 7,
    "delay_between_comments_min": 360,
    "delay_between_comments_max": 600,
    "headless_mode": true
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Limits each account to 150 comments per day (safe)
- Makes 3-7 comments per session (natural)
- Waits 6-10 minutes between comments (very safe)
- Runs in background (good for servers)
